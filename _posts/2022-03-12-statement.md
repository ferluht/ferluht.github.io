First things first: I'm Russian, I'm against the war, I'm against Putin.

Now I'm like many of my friends and colleagues compelled to leave Russia and move to one of the close countries. I'm saying compelled because there is almost no other way to do valuable things at this moment. While staying in Russia you can easily be imprisoned for any action against this regime. You don't even need to go protesting on a central square, any small post in your social network could be actually used as evidence. There are already many cases, just google it.

Due to propaganda, there is a huge gap between different social strata in Russia. And it's what the regime is based on. Media is the main Putin's weapon against Russians. Russian media structure was developed many years and now has lots of ways to reach different people's minds with different types of lie. If you just went to a central square with a banner you will lose. To win you need to place banners in people's minds and this is a very difficult task.

Here, abroad, we at least we can do some small but valuable action. For example, we help to raise humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian people. But unfortunately, we face the aggression of many locals, overpriced (or even unavailable) services and canceling by nation criteria. We are not rednecks, many of us are well-educated, skilled and global-minded. But now we became enemies both in Russia and abroad. It doesn't matter for them do you support Putin or not, do you help Ukrainians or not, if you are Russian then you are an enemy. 

More than that, global companies one-by-one are canceling Russians by nation criteria. Visa and Mastercard just blocked all Russia-issued cards abroad. Many of us now have no access to our money. Is it fair?

Finally, I want to declare one of those small but valuable actions that I can do right now as an nft artist. All the income from the next works will go to support those Russians abroad who help Ukrainians and do what's possible to fight this regime but face aggression and xenophobia. I don't want them to get angry and give up due to this mental pressure.
